Hello i'm Krzysztof and this is my first Java Program in Github.

##Tank programm specification

This is programm calculate how many liquid is in tank. 
You can added multiple tanks, pour in liquid and pour out.
Waldemar in instagram was my inspiration for writing this programm.
Here is one screenshot of an Instagram Story [Click here](https://zapodaj.net/0db632aaa4573.jpg.html).
I changed the programm assumption.

## My assumption

1. Create Class with three atributes (How many liquid, how many volume, number Tank) and method :
  -add tank
  -pour in liquid, but there is less liquid in the tank than the tank is volume
  -pour out liquid, but there is more liquid in the tank than tank volume
  -transfer liquid
  -edit tank
  -remove tank
2. Create method 
  -find, the tank with most fluid
  -find, the tank is most full tank
  -find, all full tank
